# eXchains

With consumers of electricity now also becoming producers at a higher rate, more imbalance is created on the electrical grid. To guarantee delivery of energy, the imbalance should be kept within the limits of the grid. Currently the transmission system operator (TSO: Tennet in Netherlands) is responsible for maintaining this balance. A problem arises when the production becomes more and more decentralized, and the balancing is still the duty of a centralized body. It becomes harder to respond on the highly fluctuating consumption and production of the different actors.

The aim of this project is to design and prototype a decentralized energy market and a so called 'smart grid' where participants of the smart grid can dynamically match their supply and demand to minimize imbalances.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Docker (on Windows needs Hyper-V enabled) [Download](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)

### Running

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

* Start Docker

* navigate to eXchains/tendermint/

* run command: docker-compose up --build

output should look someting like this:
```
Give the example
```

* to shutdown press ctrl-C twice and run command: docker-compose down -v
